Welcome to Wanderly, a social media platform designed for travelers to share their adventures, connect with fellow wanderers, and inspire the community with their experiences. This project was created as part of the CSS Frameworks Course Assignment for the Front-End Development program at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## Project Goal and Description 💫
The goal for this assignment was to learn how to use a CSS framework to style our social media app.
Wanderly is a small social media UI prototype for travelers. The project’s purpose was to explore Tailwind’s utility-first workflow, layout, spacing, dark mode, and reusable components.
#Notes
- Static mockup: no authentication, database, or API.
- “Login” accepts any email + 8+ char password and simply navigates to demo pages
- “New Post”, “Edit Profile”, search/sort, etc. are non-functional placeholders.

## Pages 👩🏽‍💻
- index.html – Authentication (mock)
- feed/index.html – Explore posts
- profile/index.html – My profile
- profile/user1..user4/index.html – Sample user profiles

- profile/edit/index.html – Edit profile (mock)
