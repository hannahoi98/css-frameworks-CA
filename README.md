## Wanderly: A Social Media App for Travelers 🌏✈

Welcome to Wanderly, a social media platform designed for travelers to share their adventures, connect with fellow wanderers, and inspire the community with their experiences. This project was created as part of the CSS Frameworks Course Assignment for the Front-End Development program at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

# Project Goal 💫
The goal for this assignment was to learn how to use a CSS framework to style our social media app. 
I choose Tailwind CSS, and the styling was the main focus.

There is minimal JavaScript in this project, but I would love to incorporate a API for this project later instead of creating everything with HTML.

# Project Overview 👩🏽‍💻
The assignment required the creation of a social media app with the following pages:

- Authentication Page (/index.html)
- Feed Page (/feed/index.html)
- Profile Page (/profile/index.html)

I also decided to implement: 
- User Pages (/profile/user1/index.html, /profile/user2/index.html, /profile/user3/index.html, /profile/user4/index.html)
- New Post Page (/post/new/index.html)
- Edit Profile Page (/profile/edit/index.html)

# Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring and adding content.
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Basic functionality like toggling mobile menus and changing between light and dark mode.

# Development Tools
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky
- Node.js
